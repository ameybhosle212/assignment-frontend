Shopping Portal

Setup in local:
 1. clone this repository
 2. npm install

 By doing above things the code start in local.
 So this is Shopping portal , having listing , adding a particular product to cart and checkout functionality .
 AWS link to this website is - https://master.d2t1pt6h7t4yie.amplifyapp.com/

 So for frontend we have used Vite (react), for user login and dashboard email functionality we have used AWS lambda to check for user and send token 
 and for database we have used MongoDB.
